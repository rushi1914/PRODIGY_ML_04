# Task 4: Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe ✋🤖

This project was completed as part of the **Machine Learning Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**.

The goal of this task was to create a real-time **hand gesture recognition system** using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a lightweight, real-time computer vision system that detects hand landmarks and recognizes gestures using MediaPipe.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) by Google
- OpenCV for video feed
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook / .py script

---

## 📦 Project File

- `Task4_hand-gesture-recognition-mediapipe-main.zip` contains:
  - Main Python script (`gesture_tracker.py` or similar)
  - MediaPipe hand tracking logic
  - OpenCV video stream
  - Gesture mapping module (e.g., finger count, "peace", "thumbs up")

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Real-time hand tracking via webcam
- 🖐️ Landmark detection of 21 hand keypoints
- ✌️ Gesture classification (peace, thumbs up, etc.)
- 🧠 Easily extendable for custom gestures

---


## 🧠 Learnings

- Using **MediaPipe**'s hand detection module
- Frame capture and overlay with OpenCV
- Mapping hand landmarks to gesture logic
- Building efficient real-time systems in Python
